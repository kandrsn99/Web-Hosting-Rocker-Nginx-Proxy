You may check your application via web hosting service on http://localhost:80/ or the server address on http://address:80/

You may purchase a domain name server (DNS) register to point to your new hosts internet protocol (IP) address. Upon completion of pointing a DNS at the host you may use http://dominame name to send to all your friends and/or customers. The customized domain name may be added if you read about the official NGINX docker image documentation here https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/ which was modified for this repository.

Do note that you must retrieve an SSL (secure socket layet) certificate to have HTTPs working for your domain name. The NGINX configuration file is meant to be easy to follow and understand. Read it and make sure the certificates are stored in the correct locations with the proper naming schema for NGINX. An easy way to create SSL certificate may be done with openSSL, https://openssl.org/, from the command line or otherwise downloaded from the DNS provider. 

It is highly recommended that you use Cloudflare as they are the leading provider of a register for hosting a DNS. You may review their documentation here https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/get-started/ at your leisure.
